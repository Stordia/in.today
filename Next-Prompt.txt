You are working on the in.today platform (Laravel 12 + Filament v3, multi-panel: Admin, Business, User).

We are currently in Phase 1 (Restaurant Booking MVP).  
Public booking (/book/{slug}), deposits and Business reservations management are already working and tested.

NOW we want to implement a **Business Panel page for managing Opening Hours & Special Dates** for each venue.

Context / Existing models & logic
- There is already an `opening_hours` table used by `AvailabilityService` and the public booking widget.
- There is already a `blocked_dates` table used to block certain dates from availability.
- AvailabilityService + PublicBookingController already respect opening hours and blocked dates (do NOT change that logic now).
- A venue = `Restaurant` model (we still call it Restaurant in code).

Goal
Give each venue owner/manager a **simple Business Panel UI** to manage:

1. Weekly opening hours (per day of week).
2. Special dates / closures (blocked dates).

No one should need to go to the Admin panel for these.

Business Panel tech context
- Business panel Filament namespace is: `App\Filament\Restaurant\...`
- We already have:
  - `/business/reservations`
  - `/business/restaurant-settings` ("Business Settings" page)
- Routes are handled via Filament’s Restaurant panel configuration.

========================================
PART A – New Business Page: “Opening Hours”
========================================

Create a new Filament page in the Business panel:

- Class: `App\Filament\Restaurant\Pages\OpeningHoursSettings`
- Route: `/business/opening-hours`
- Navigation:
  - Group: e.g. “Settings”
  - Label: “Opening Hours”
  - Icon: something simple (e.g. `heroicon-o-clock`)
  - Only visible to restaurant users (owners/managers/staff) – NOT platform admins.

UX requirements
- Use the same **dark mode / spacing / card style** as `RestaurantSettings` and `Reservations`.
- Page title: **Opening Hours & Special Dates**
- Subheading: “Manage your regular weekly hours and special closed days for this venue.”

Tabs
Use Filament’s tabbed layout (similar to our PlatformSettings / AffiliateHub patterns):

1. **“Regular Hours” tab**
2. **“Special Dates” tab**

### 1) Regular Hours tab

We already have an `opening_hours` table with fields like:
- restaurant_id
- day_of_week (0–6 or 1–7 depending on existing model)
- is_open (bool)
- opens_at (time)
- closes_at (time)

Your task:
- Reuse the existing `OpeningHour` model (do NOT change schema).
- For each day of week, show a row:

  - Day label (Mon, Tue, …) using current locale (en for now)
  - Toggle: “Open this day”
  - When enabled:
    - Time inputs: "Opens at" and "Closes at" (HH:MM, 24h format)
  - When disabled:
    - Show “Closed”

- Use a **clean layout**, for example:
  - A `Section` titled “Regular Weekly Hours”
  - Inside it, a `Grid` with 1 row per day (or a Repeater grouped visually by day).
- Persist changes for the **current restaurant** (the one linked to the logged-in user via restaurant_users).

Assumptions:
- For this MVP, **support only one time range per day** (`opens_at`–`closes_at`).
- If the restaurant currently has no rows in `opening_hours`, initialize defaults:
  - is_open = false for all days
  - Or sensible initial values for a typical venue (e.g. 17:00–23:00 for Fri/Sat) – you decide, but keep it simple.

Validation:
- If is_open = true:
  - opens_at < closes_at
- If times invalid, show a friendly error message per day.

### 2) Special Dates tab (Blocked Dates)

We already have a `blocked_dates` table used by AvailabilityService.

Assumed fields (adjust to actual schema in the project):
- id
- restaurant_id
- date (date or datetime)
- is_all_day (bool)
- start_time (nullable)
- end_time (nullable)
- reason (nullable text)

Your task:
- Create a `Section` titled “Special Dates & Closures”.
- Use a **Repeater** for blocked dates for the current restaurant, with fields:
  - `date` (Date picker, required)
  - `is_all_day` (Toggle: “All day closure”)
  - If NOT all day:
    - `start_time` (time)
    - `end_time` (time)
  - `reason` (short text, optional, e.g. “Private event”)

- Add helper text, e.g.:
  - “Use this to block specific days (e.g. holidays, private events, renovations).”
- Entries should be **sorted ascending by date**.
- Validation:
  - If `is_all_day = true`: `start_time` and `end_time` can be null.
  - If `is_all_day = false`: `start_time` and `end_time` required AND `start_time < end_time`.

IMPORTANT:
- This page ONLY manages data; do NOT change AvailabilityService logic.
- AvailabilityService already uses opening_hours + blocked_dates; we just provide a better UI.

========================================
PART B – Access control & multi-restaurant support
========================================

- A Business user may be linked to multiple restaurants.
- Follow the **existing pattern** used in `/business/reservations` and `/business/restaurant-settings` to:
  - Determine the “current restaurant” (e.g. first active one or chosen context).
  - Ensure a user can only edit opening hours / blocked dates for their own restaurant(s).
- If user has **no restaurants**:
  - Show a nice empty state: “You are not linked to any venue yet.”

========================================
PART C – Tests
========================================

Add a new Feature test file:

- `tests/Feature/BusinessOpeningHoursSettingsTest.php`

Include at least the following tests:

1. `test_restaurant_user_can_access_opening_hours_page`
   - Create a restaurant + user relation.
   - Act as restaurant user.
   - GET `/business/opening-hours`.
   - Assert 200 and see page title.

2. `test_non_restaurant_user_cannot_access_opening_hours_page`
   - User without restaurant relation.
   - Assert redirect or 403 (follow whichever pattern is used in Business panel).

3. `test_regular_hours_can_be_updated_for_each_day`
   - Seed some opening_hours rows.
   - POST/PUT updated values via the form.
   - Assert DB has the new opens_at/closes_at and is_open.

4. `test_special_dates_can_be_created_and_updated`
   - Add blocked date via form.
   - Assert DB row created for blocked_dates with correct restaurant_id.

5. `test_closed_days_are_marked_with_is_open_false`
   - Set a day as closed from the UI.
   - Assert is_open=false in DB.

6. `test_partial_day_block_requires_start_and_end_time`
   - Try saving blocked date with is_all_day=false but missing times.
   - Assert validation errors on start_time/end_time.

7. (Optional, if easy) `test_opening_hours_page_uses_current_restaurant_context`
   - If user linked to 2 restaurants, ensure page loads for the expected one (reuse existing pattern from reservations/settings).

========================================
PART D – Non-Goals / Constraints
========================================

- Do NOT change `AvailabilityService` or `PublicBookingController` logic now.
- Do NOT introduce multiple opening ranges per day (keep 1 range per day for now).
- Keep the UI consistent with existing Business panel (dark mode, spacing, typography).
- Follow the same patterns used in `RestaurantSettings` for:
  - Determining the current restaurant.
  - Flash notifications (“Settings saved”).
  - Validation & form submission.
